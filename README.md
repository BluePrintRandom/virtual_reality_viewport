# Virtual Reality Viewport
Addon to bring virtual reality devices to the Blender viewport.

This is work in progress/pre-alpha state, use at your own risk.

How to Use
==========

In the viewport press ``Space`` + ``Virtual Reality Viewport``.

And then press:
* ``Alt + F11`` (Window Fullscreen)
* ``Alt + F10`` (Fullscreen Area and Hide Panels)

Current State
=============

Installation
============
In a terminal paste the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dfelinto/virtual_reality_viewport.git
$ cd virtual_reality_viewport
$ git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
$ zip -x __pycache__ -x */.git* -r9 space_view3d_virtual_reality.zip space_view3d_virtual_reality
```

Now install the space_view3d_virtual_reality.zip in Blender as an addon.

Update
======
The following commands are for Mac, some changes are needed for other OSs:

```
$ git pull origin
$ git submodule update --recursive --remote
$ rsync -rv --exclude=.DS_Store --exclude=.git --exclude=*.blend1 --exclude=*.blend2 --exclude=*.swp --exclude=*.swo space_view3d_virtual_reality ~/Library/Application\ Support/Blender/2.74/scripts/addons/
```

Optionally, instead of rsync you can generate a new ``.zip``, remove the previous version of the addon and re-install it.

Roadmap
=======
Oculus DK2 is currently working. The next step is to support view navigation (`Shift + F`) within the addon.

Later we can make it flexible enough to support other HMD devices.

There are a few things I still need to implement:
* Automatically go to clean fullscreen (Alt+F10) and fullwindow (Alt+F11)

Feel free to send pull requests to any of the above.
